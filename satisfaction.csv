R_6tlqm3Vhb1CNHiR,8,"""Qualtrics has a great tool for building surveys that is very versatile and easy to use.  There are lots of things you guys are doing well.  However, there are a number of ways in which your solution does not work well for transactional surveys and reporting back.  We've been setup with an account for 6 months, but integration and branding for transactional surveys off of Support interactions have taken quite a while to get implemented.  Everyone at Qualtrics has been quite helpful, but a lot of what we're trying to emulate from our previous deployment (which was very limited) has run into roadblocks of the tool.  In order to integrate properly with embedded data, we've needed to setup a web service for handling metadata.  After setting this up, integration of the data has been much better, but handling complex reports within Qualtrics has become cumbersome.  We've previously used GoodData with Zendesk, and the integration of those two platforms has been superb.  I have not had as much luck with Qualtrics reporting providing the versatility of GoodData, or options for customization of reporting. /  / I'm excited to see what you guys can do with your reporting tools, but at this point I feel like despite the amount of time we've spend deploying the solution, I still have a significant trek to make to get to a complete solution.  Some of the tools/integrations that could be put in place to help our organization would be: / 1. Allow triggers to be cloned and reconfigured.  Better yet, devise a way to create/input numerous triggers with one or two variables (like sending feedback to 60 different agents, where the trigger is the same except for one ED field) / 2. The panel system is great, but the ability to handle transactional surveys needs to be better.  For example, I'd like to setup one response per ticket ID (an ED field), since each customer can open multiple tickets, and should be able to give different feedback to the same survey via multiple tickets.  However, I don't want people to submit multiple surveys on the same ticket.  Right now, I have to download the data to Excel, search for duplicates, manually remove the appropriate response_ids and then re-check every few weeks or month. / 3. Reporting tools are scattered.  I opened a ticket on how to create a simple promoter report per agent (or group, or any other metadata field).  With 35 agents in Tier 1, the report quickly ran off the page, and horizontal reporting wasn't the best option.  So, I wanted to make a vertical report for each agent to show % promoter, % detractor, and NPS.  The solution was to make 35 different reports, each with a different agent_name filter and manually label each one.  However, instead of handling it that way, I took another look at the cross tabs portion and wrote up a report in 5 minutes that did the same thing.  Granted, I can only display it in 9 colors, but it'd be nice to have the same functionality under the ""reporting"" tab. / 4. Time filtering needs help.  I need to run weekly KPI reports that rely on a set timeframe, and track progress in each current week as well as reporting on the previous weeks.  Right now, I cannot do that.  I can filter by weeks, but the date moves based upon the timeframe when looking at the report.  This is obviously bad for comparing historical information.  If I use a set time frame, I'd have to adjust it each week and there's no way to have a floating 3 or 4 week window.  I want to see this week, and the last 3 weeks as comparison, but I see no effective way to implement that option. /  / I hope this helps your team understand the challenges we've had for handling our particular deployment.  Likely, there are not that many organizations looking to implement what we are doing.  Perhaps many organizations use external reporting tools, such as GoodData or SSPS to handle the data once passed through Qualtrics.  I'm hoping to use Qualtrics as our entire solution, but exporting the data to GoodData or another tool might be a requirement if we're not able to address some of the business requirements above."""
